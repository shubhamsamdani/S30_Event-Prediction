# S30_Event-Prediction
We have studied all the pre-requisites(research papers on social synchrony, event detection on twitter, stock market prediction, different types of tweets depending upon emotions and sentiments) needed for the completion of the project and have implemented the code of event detection. Further we have discussed with our faculty mentor as to how to proceed further. We have developed certain hypothesis on which we are currently doing research such as trying to find the correlation between various parameters of social synchrony and various factors such as emotions, sentiments, how people are affected by a certain type of situation etc.

We have studied about tweepy, a python library for twitter and are currently using it to extract various twitter data and analyse it.
